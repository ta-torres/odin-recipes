# odin-recipes
odin-recipes consists on building a basic recipe website. The website contains a main index page with hyperlinks to a few recipes. These recipes will have a description and image followed by an ingredients list and step by step explanation needed to make the dish.

This project is part of the Foundations course on Web Development at The Odin Project. Its main objective is to learn the basics of HTML  as well as to learn the fundamentals of Git's version control system. It may be improved upon in the future as needed with CSS and JS.
